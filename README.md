The Cafeteria is a short adventure game where players control a student to look for the most hidden cafeteria in his university's building. During the playthrough, players will have to keep an eye out for the student's stamina as it results in a game over if it hits zero. Furthermore, players will also encounter other fellow students who might give them a huge advantage on their journey to find the cafeteria, or drag them down. The Cafeteria is a game that centers around decision making, and that is every decision yield a consequence.
